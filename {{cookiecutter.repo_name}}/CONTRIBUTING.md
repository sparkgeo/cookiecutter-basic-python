# How to contribute

Thanks for reading this. We love having external collaborators on our OpenSource projects.

## Testing

If submitting a PR, please ensure the code has appropriate tests.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We follow PEP8 for Python projects with a modification for 100 length lines.
    * We use tools like [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to help with formatting.
